				<p class="Para1">App Design | UI | UX<br><br>The vegan assistant is a mobile application concept that I came up when I first went vegan. If you have ever attempted to implement a new foodie lifestyle: keto, vegan, or other, you know first-hand how daunting it can be to find the right information and trackers to make your journey a success. For months I dealt with the common frustrations of eating	foods that I thought were vegan but had hidden animal by products, and others meals that were vegan but not balanced nutritionally, and the worse, falling into 'research rabbit holes' only to discover the information you found was inaccurate.	From this I decided to design & develop a mobile application that gave vegans access to the best vegan recipes, accurate information on transitioning properly and, best of all, a tracker that monitors your nutritional intake for the week.
